For the following year, I intend to study `A Data Analytics Approach
to Fantasy Football Management'. For this, I will need to analyse the data
from the Premier League API, and predict and manage the best teams week
in week out, using strategies I learn throughout the year. I will also create
an appealing GUI containing stats on players over the season, show different
strategies for users to try, and other useful information for the user for ease,
such as upcoming matches and a league table (similar to the Premier League
app).

This will involve retrieving data from an API, before analysing and clean
ing. I plan to do the pre-processing of data using Pandas and Jupyter in
Python, and apply different models to the data, in order to create the different
strategies for the user to choose from. I plan to use Java for the front-end
GUI by running the Python script from Java when necessary. I intend to
use Java Swing for the GUI, but I will research and review other external
libraries to ensure I use the most approprite library.
